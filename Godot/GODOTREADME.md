### View the Godot docs for setting up a base Node and HTTPrequest Node.
The docs call for a CanvasLayer but you can use a Node as the GDScript file is setup for it.
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/http_request_class.html

## Currently setup to transmit strings.
You can do further work to encode to JSON on both PHP and GDScript side but that is beyond the scope of this setup guide, see the available online Godot and PHP docs for further setup instructions on JSON encoding.
